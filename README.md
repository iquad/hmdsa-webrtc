# Problem

["WebRTC"](https://webrtc.org/) is a free, open project that provides browsers and mobile applications with Real-Time Communications (RTC) capabilities via simple APIs. The WebRTC components have been optimized to best serve this purpose. Without a signaling server, WebRTC users, need to give created keys to other users to communicate.

The objectives are simple:

- Write a simple JS websocket signaling server to get SSID of peer and connect it to second peer.
- Develop that function as channel mechanism to let third peer join them.
- After a peer disconnects, stop its connection between it and other peers, and give that info to other peers.

## Requirements

- The data which is sent by any of peers, should be received by other peers.
- Data should be sent via webRTC, not websockets itself.
- Code should be readable, commented step by step.
- Code should be hosted on GitHub.

## Up To You
- You may or may not write tests.
- You can use helper libraries, but not sample WebRTC libraries on your code.
- You can use ES2015, ES2016 or whatever you want on your code.

## Time
- You have **7** (seven) days to complete that task. After that, your questions will be declined -yes, even if it was true!-.

## Contact
- You are free to communicate with authorized person when you need.
